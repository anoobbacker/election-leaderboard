# Kasaragod
To predict the election result for the Kasaragod constituency in 2024, let us consider the historical data, voter turnout, current candidates, and potential changes in voter behavior:
### Historical Data Analysis
1. **2009 Election:**
   - **Elected Member:** P. Karunakaran (CPI(M))
   - **Vote Share:** 45.55%
   - **Margin:** 64,427
   - **Turnout:** 76.01%
2. **2014 Election:**
   - **Elected Member:** P. Karunakaran (CPI(M))
   - **Vote Share:** 39.52%
   - **Margin:** 6,921
   - **Turnout:** 78.41%
3. **2019 Election:**
   - **Elected Member:** Rajmohan Unnithan (INC)
   - **Vote Share:** 43.18%
   - **Margin:** 40,438
   - **Turnout:** 80.66%
### 2024 Candidates
- **UDF Party:** INC, Candidate: Rajmohan Unnithan
- **LDF Party:** CPI(M), Candidate: MV Balakrishnan
- **NDA Party:** BJP, Candidate: ML Ashwini
### 2024 Voter Turnout
- **Total Electors:** 1,452,230
- **Votes Polled:** 1,104,331
- **Turnout Percentage:** 76.04%
- **Change from 2019:** Decrease of 4.62%
### Predicted Analysis
1. **Turnout Trends:** Turnout percentage in 2024 is slightly lower than in 2019 but still substantial. High voter turnout can typically indicate higher engagement and possibly a desire for change. However, in Kasaragod, historical data show that CPI(M) held the seat for two terms before INC took it in 2019 with significant margins.
2. **Incumbency Factor:** Rajmohan Unnithan (INC) won with a comfortable margin in 2019. As the incumbent, he benefits from name recognition and can leverage his past work in the constituency.
3. **Party Dynamics:** 
   - **CPI(M) (LDF):** Managed to hold onto the seat for two consecutive terms despite a lowering vote share in 2014, nearly losing the seat.
   - **INC (UDF):** Took the seat in 2019 with a substantial margin, showing a strong performance and possibly gaining the support of swing voters.
   - **BJP (NDA):** Has been a weaker contender in the past elections without securing a winning position.
### Prediction for 2024
Given the historical trends, decrease in turnout, and the current political dynamics:
- **Predicted Elected Member:** Rajmohan Unnithan
- **Predicted Elected Party:** INC (UDF)
- **Predicted Margin:** 25,000 - 35,000 votes (due to potential marginal decrease in margin but still maintaining a solid lead)
- **Predicted Vote Share:** Approximately 44% (marginally increased or maintained with the current support base)
### Conclusion:
Rajmohan Unnithan of the INC is likely to be re-elected, predominantly due to incumbency, his previous performance, and the vote share dynamics in the constituency. The CPI(M) will present a strong challenge but is expected to fall short again, and BJP will remain a lesser contender in Kasaragod.'

- Third Gender Votes: 3
### Current Candidates:
- **UDF (INC):** K. Sudhakaran

- **NDA (BJP):** C Raghunath
### Analysis:
1. **Trends and Voter Turnout:**
   - The turnout has decreased by 6.07% compared to the last election, which might indicate voter apathy or shifting voter behavior.
   - Historically, K. Sudhakaran has had a strong presence in Kannur, winning in both 2009 and 2019 with significant margins.
   - The competitive nature of the 2014 election, where CPI(M) narrowly won, shows that voter sentiments can be volatile.
2. **Party Performance and Candidate Strength:**
   - INC generally has a strong hold in the region, evident from past performance.
   - LDF has also shown its capability to contest closely but has not been significantly able to surpass Sudhakaran in the majority of recent terms.
   - BJP has a negligible presence historically in Kannur, unlikely to dramatically change the power balance.
3. **Demographics:**
   - A noticeable increase in the number of female voters compared to male voters might affect the outcome. Policies and campaign strategies appealing to female voters could be decisive.
### Prediction:
Given the consistent performance of K. Sudhakaran and the strong INC presence in Kannur, it is likely that he will continue to hold the seat. The reduced voter turnout might slightly lower the vote share percentages across all parties but is unlikely to shift the power balance dramatically away from Sudhakaran and INC.
#### Predicted Outcome for 2024:
- **Predicted Elected Member:** K. Sudhakaran
- **Predicted Elected Party:** INC
- **Predicted Vote Share:** Approximately 49-51%
- **Predicted Margin:** Around 50,000 - 70,000 votes
This prediction takes into account historical election patterns, voter turnout changes, and current political dynamics in the constituency."
# Vatakara
content="To predict the election result for the Vatakara constituency in 2024, we need to analyze the data from previous elections, current voter turnout, and the political candidates.
### Analysis of Previous Elections
1. **2009:**
   - Elected Member: Mullappally Ramachandran
   - Elected Party: INC
   - Vote Share: 48.82%
   - Margin: 56186
2. **2014:**
   - Elected Member: Mullappally Ramachandran

3. **2019:**

   - Elected Party: INC
   - Vote Share: 49.43%
   - Margin: 84663
### 2024 Election Details
- **Candidates:**
  - UDF: INC candidate Shafi Parambil
  - LDF: CPI(M) candidate K.K. Shailaja
  - NDA: BJP candidate Prafulla Krishna
- **Voter Turnout and Demographics:**
  - Total Electors: 1,421,883
  - Votes Polled: 1,114,950
  - Turnout: 78.41% (Decrease 4.29% from the last election)
### Trend and Interpretation
1. **INC (UDF):**
   - Historically strong with consistent leadership.
   - Despite a decrease in voter turnout, they have maintained substantial margins previously, showing strong ground support in Vatakara.
   - K. Muraleedharan's performance in 2019 marked a significant increase from 2014, indicating positive momentum for the INC in this area.
2. **CPI(M) (LDF):**
   - K.K. Shailaja is a strong candidate with significant recognition, which could potentially swing voters towards LDF, especially considering the performance during her tenure as the Health Minister.
   - However, the historical data shows Vatakara leaning towards INC, but the CPI(M)'s strength in Kerala shouldn't be underestimated.
3. **BJP (NDA):**
   - Historically, BJP hasn't been strong in this constituency, and the decrease in overall turnout might not significantly benefit them due to their lower base.
### Predictive Conclusion
- **Predicted Elected Member:** Shafi Parambil
- **Predicted Elected Party:** INC
- **Predicted Margin:** Approximately 50,000 votes
- **Predicted Vote Share%:** Around 48%
### Rationale
- **Historical Dominance:** The INC has shown consistent performance in Vatakara, with solid margins even when voter turnout fluctuated.
- **Candidate Strength:** Shafi Parambil brings fresh energy, potentially appealing to the younger demographic and urban middle class.
- **Turnout Analysis:** A slight decrease in turnout traditionally affects incumbents less if their foundational support remains strong, as with the INC.
  
Given K.K. ShailajaÆs prominence, the race could be closer than 2019 but the historical strength of the INC and their candidateÆs promising profile should give them the edge.
Thus, the Vatakara constituency is likely to stay with the INC, with Shafi Parambil being elected, maintaining a substantial although slightly reduced margin compared to the previous election due to reduced turnout and competitive opposition.

### Historical Analysis:

  - Female: 555,033
  - Third Gender: 3
### Trends and Predictions:
1. **INC's Stronghold:**
   - The data from 2009 to 2019 indicate that INC has consistently held Wayanad, with Rahul Gandhi securing a significantly higher vote share and margin in 2019. Despite a decrease in turnout in 2024, Rahul Gandhi's popularity and party loyalty may remain strong.
   
2. **Turnout % Factor:**
   - Although there is a decrease in turnout (6.80%), the absolute number of votes polled still reflects a competitive engagement among the electorate.
3. **Voting Patterns:**
   - Gender distribution indicates a balanced voter engagement across male and female voters, with a slight edge for female voters.
Given these factors, the prediction for the 2024 constituency election in Wayanad is as follows:
- **Predicted Elected Member:** Rahul Gandhi
- **Predicted Elected Party:** INC
- **Predicted Margin:** Given the large margins in the past, especially a significant margin in 2019, even if we consider a competitive race and some loss in vote share, a margin of around 250,000 votes seems likely.
- **Predicted Vote Share %:** Considering the decrease in turnout and potential challenges, Rahul Gandhi's vote share might decrease slightly. A likely prediction would be around 55-60%.
### Final Prediction:
- **Predicted Elected Member:** Rahul Gandhi
- **Predicted Elected Party:** INC
- **Predicted Margin:** ~250,000 votes
- **Predicted Vote Share:** 57%
This prediction reflects a strong incumbency advantage, robust party base, and the impact of Rahul Gandhi's presence in the constituency."

2. **Consistent IUML Dominance:** IUML has held this seat through the last three election cycles with varying margins, suggesting a stronghold in this constituency.
3. **Candidate Effect:** The change from E. T. Mohammed Basheer to Abdussamad Samadani (IUML) might bring a slight variation in voting patterns but should not drastically alter the party's dominant position, given the incumbency advantage.

  - BJP: Approximately 15-17%

# Alathur (SC)
To predict the election result for the Alathur (SC) constituency in 2024, we need to consider several key factors: trends in voter turnout, previous election results, and candidates' profiles and affiliations. Here's a detailed analysis:

**1. Historical Trends:**
   - **2009**: CPI(M)'s P. K. Biju won with a vote share of 46.84% and a margin of 20960.
   - **2014**: CPI(M)'s P. K. Biju won again with a reduced vote share of 44.36% but increased margin of 37312.
   - **2019**: INC's Ramya Haridas won decisively with a vote share of 52.4% and a significantly higher margin of 158968.

**2. Voter Turnout:**
   - There is a slight dip in the voter turnout in 2024 compared to 2019 (73.42% vs. 80.47%). A lower turnout generally favors the incumbents or the party with a more dedicated voter base.

**3. Party and Candidate Analysis:**
   - **INC (UDF)**: Ramya Haridas, the current incumbent, won with a comfortable margin previously, showing strong support.
   - **CPI(M) (LDF)**: K. Radhakrishnan, representing the LDF, which had a strong history in the constituency before 2019.
   - **BJP (NDA)**: TN Sarasu, typically, BJP faces challenges in strongholds of INC and CPI(M) in Kerala, making it less likely to win here without a significant shift.

**4. Demographic and Voting Pattern Analysis:**
   - **Gender Votes**: Female voters outnumber male voters slightly, and a candidate with appeal to female voters might have an edge.
   - Given Ramya Haridas's previous victory margin and her incumbency, she likely sustains significant support, especially among female voters.
**5. Voter Behavior and Regional political Climate:**
   - The regional political climate in Kerala often swings between UDF and LDF. Given the strong win margin for the INC in 2019, Ramya Haridas has an advantage.
   - The larger margin in favor of the INC in 2019 indicates significant favor, which may carry into the 2024 elections unless there have been major shifts in voter sentiment or significant local issues.

Based on the analysis, the prediction is as follows:
- **Predicted Elected Member**: Ramya Haridas
- **Predicted Elected Party**: INC (UDF)
- **Predicted Margin**: Approximately 100,000 (Given a slight decrease in turnout which might slightly reduce the previously large margin)
- **Predicted Vote Share %**: Approximately 50% (Reflecting a solid, though slightly reduced, support due to lower turnout)
These predictions take into account the historical trends, candidate profiles, and current voter dynamics."

# Thrissur
To predict the election results for the Thrissur constituency in 2024, let's analyze the data and trends from previous elections:
1. **Historical Trend Analysis**:

   - **2014**: Turnout increased to 72.19%.
   - **2019**: Turnout further increased to 77.94%.
   - **2024**: Turnout is 72.9%, which is a decrease of 5.04% from 2019.
3. **Voter Demographics**: 
   - In 2024, the total electors are 1,483,055 with 1,081,125 votes polled.
   - The male and female voter turnout indicates a slightly higher female voter turnout. Male: 509,052; Female: 572,067; Third Gender: 6.
4. **Candidate and Party Analysis**:
   - **INC (UDF)**: K Muraleedharan
   - **CPI (LDF)**: VS Sunil Kumar
   - **BJP (NDA)**: Suresh Gopi
Given the trends:
- The vote share for major parties like INC and CPI has oscillated, while INC reclaimed the seat in 2019 with a significant margin.
- Typically, the voter turnout plays a crucial role; the slight decrease from 2019 might affect voter enthusiasm or indicate voter saturation.

**Prediction for 2024**:
Considering these factors and historical trends:
- **Predicted Elected Member**: K Muraleedharan
- **Predicted Elected Party**: INC (UDF)
- **Predicted Margin**: Approximately 60,000 votes.
- **Predicted Vote Share%**: Approximately 43-45%.
Rationale:
- INC has shown resilience and capability to reclaim the constituency with strong margins, and with experienced candidates like K Muraleedharan, they are well-positioned.
- The CPI and BJP will split the remaining votes, with CPI being a strong contender but traditionally performing lower when INC consolidates its base.
- The lower turnout decrease suggests a stabilization rather than a significant shift in voter preference."

   - Elected Member: Innocent
   - Elected Party: Independent
   - Vote Share: 40.55%
   - Margin: 13,884
   - Turnout: 76.93%
   
3. **2019:**
   - Elected Member: Benny Behanan
   - Elected Party: INC
   - Vote Share: 47.81%
   - Margin: 132,274
   - Turnout: 80.51%
### 2024 Election Dynamics:
#### Candidates:
- **UDF (INC):** Benny Behanan (incumbent)
- **LDF (CPI(M)):** C Raveendranath
- **NDA (BDJS):** KA Unnikrishnan
#### Voter Turnout:
- **Total Voters:** 1,310,529
- **Votes Polled:** 942,787
- **Turnout:** 71.94% (decrease of 8.57%)
### Analysis:
1. **UDF Strength (INC):**
   - Historically strong presence with K. P. Dhanapalan and Benny Behanan winning in 2009 and 2019 with significant margins.
   - Benny Behanan's incumbency could provide additional benefits due to voter familiarity and trust.
2. **LDF Presence (CPI(M)):**
   - Strong in regions with candidate profile like C Raveendranath.
   - However, have not won in the analyzed years, indicating a weaker ground compared to INC.
3. **NDA (BDJS):**
   - Minimal historical presence in the constituency.
   - Given that NDA hasn't won this seat in the past three elections, it implies a relatively smaller base.
4. **Turnout Impact:**
   - A notable decrease in turnout (71.94% vs. an average of >75% in previous years) could affect all parties but typically incumbents and parties with strong grassroots mobilization (such as INC) might be less affected.
### Prediction for 2024:
Based on the analysis, here's the predicted result:
- **Predicted Elected Member:** Benny Behanan
- **Predicted Elected Party:** Indian National Congress (INC)
- **Predicted Margin:** Approximately 80,000 votes
- **Predicted Vote Share%:** Around 50%
### Reasoning:
Despite a lower turnout, the historical strength of INC in this constituency, combined with the strong margin secured by Benny Behanan in 2019, suggests a favorable outcome for him. The LDF and NDA candidates, while significant, are less likely to overcome the entrenched support for INC given the trends and voter behavior observed.
### Conclusion:
Benny Behanan from INC is expected to retain his seat in the Chalakudy constituency for the 2024 elections, continuing the pattern of strong performance by INC candidates in this region."

# Ernakulam

   - **Vote Share:** 50.79%
   - **Margin:** 169,153 votes
   - **Turnout:** 77.64%
### 2024 Context and Turnout
- **Total Electors:** 1,324,047
- **Votes Polled:** 904,131
- **Turnout:** 68.29%
  - This is a decrease in turnout of approximately 9.35% compared to the previous election year 2019.
### Candidate Analysis for 2024
- **UDF (INC):** Hibi Eden (incumbent)
- **LDF (CPI(M)):** KJ Shine
- **NDA (BJP):** KS Radhakrishnan
### Prediction Based on Trends
1. **Voter Turnout Analysis:**
   - The turnout in 2024 is relatively lower (68.29%) compared to 2019 (77.64%), indicating a potential decrease in voter enthusiasm or engagement.
   - The INC has historically benefited from high voter turnout, as seen with Hibi EdenÆs significant margin in 2019 during a high turnout year.
2. **Party and Candidate Popularity:**
   - INC candidates have consistently won in this constituency, with increasing vote shares and margins through successive election cycles (aside from 2014, where the vote share dipped but still resulted in a landslide victory margin).
   - Hibi Eden, as the incumbent, has a proven track record and a substantial victory margin from the last election.
3. **Margin and Vote Share Calculation:**
   - Given the historical trends and decreased turnout, the INC might experience slight fluctuations in vote share but is likely to retain a strong position.
   - The vote share for Hibi Eden could see a minor reduction due to the decreased turnout but is expected to remain substantial compared to his opponents.
### Final Prediction for 2024
- **Predicted Elected Member:** Hibi Eden
- **Predicted Elected Party:** INC (Indian National Congress)
- **Predicted Margin:** Approximately 120,000 votes
  - This is a calculated decrease from the previous margin due to lower turnout.
- **Predicated Vote Share:** Approximately 48%
  - This considers the reduced enthusiasm but consistent loyalty to the INC.
Therefore, I predict that Hibi Eden of the INC will continue to hold the Ernakulam constituency with a substantial margin and a significant vote share, though slightly reduced from 2019 levels due to the lower voter turnout.'

   - Joice George (Independent in 2014) is now aligning with CPI(M). His previous win in 2014 indicates he has a considerable base.
3. **Incumbency Factor:**
   - INC's Dean Kuriakose will benefit from incumbency, and his last strong performance will be a positive factor.
4. **Vote Share Trends:**
   - INC has seen increased vote shares over the years (from 51.98% in 2009 to 54.23% in 2019).

   - Lower turnout might decrease the absolute margin, but INC is still expected to have a comfortable victory.
### Conclusion
Based on the analysis of historical voting patterns, candidate strength, and the significant incumbency advantage, Dean Kuriakose from INC is predicted to be re-elected in the 2024 elections for the Idukki Constituency."

  - Votes Polled: 823,237

#### Analysis Factors
1. **Consistent Electoral Performance by KC(M)**:
   - KC(M) has had a strong hold on the constituency, winning the last three elections.
   - Despite a decrease in vote share in 2019, KC(M) still secured a comfortable margin.
2. **Turnout Analysis**:
   - The voter turnout has declined significantly by 9.86%, which can suggest varying interest levels and potential impact of localized issues or voter apathy.
   - Lower turnout typically can affect the traditional strongholds if the opposition mobilizes their base effectively.
3. **Candidate Performance and Background**:
   - Thomas Chazhikadan (KC(M)) has incumbency and the backing of an established party.
   - Francis George (KEC), while representing UDF, may capitalize on desires for change or anti-incumbency sentiments.
   - Thushar Velapally (BDJS) represents the NDA but will need a significant swing to capture the seat, especially with a lower turnout.
#### Voter Demographics:
- Male: 607,502 votes
- Female: 647,306 votes
- Third Gender: 15 votes
#### Prediction
Based on historical data, party strength, current candidates, and turnout dynamics, the prediction is as follows:
- **Predicted Elected Member**: Thomas Chazhikadan
- **Predicted Elected Party**: KC(M)
- **Predicted Margin**: 65,000
- **Predicted Vote Share%**: 45%
#### Reasoning
- KC(M) retains a strong base in Kottayam, and despite turnout fluctuation, their consolidation and organizational strength will likely aid in retaining the seat.
- The reduction in turnout could affect margins but not significantly overturn the result in favor of UDF or NDA under current political dynamics.
- Thomas Chazhikadan, having won in 2019, maintains name recognition and incumbency benefits which aligns with maintaining a slightly lower but still leading vote share.
Thus, KC(M) is poised to win the Kottayam constituency again in the 2024 elections with Thomas Chazhikadan continuing as the elected representative.'
# Alappuzha
To predict the election result for the Alappuzha constituency in 2024, we need to analyze past voting patterns, candidate popularity, changes in voter turnout, as well as the political climate.

   - Vote Share: 51.85%

- **Candidates**:
  - UDF (INC): K.C. Venugopal
  - LDF (CPI(M)): A. M. Ariff (Incumbent)
  - NDA (BJP): Sobha Surendran
- **Voter Turnout**:
  - Electors: 1,400,083
  - Votes Polled: 1,050,726
  - Turnout: 75.05% (a decrease of 5.30%)
### Analysis of Factors:
1. **Candidate Popularity**:
   - K. C. Venugopal of the INC has shown strong historical performance in 2009 and 2014 but saw diminishing margins.
   - A. M. Ariff of CPI(M) won in 2019 with a good margin, indicating a shift toward the Left Democratic Front.
2. **Vote Share Trends**:
   - INCÆs vote share decreased from 51.85% in 2009 to 46.37% in 2014.
   - CPI(M) captured the seat in 2019 with a 40.96% vote share.
3. **Turnout and Voter Behavior**:
   - There is a noticeable decline in voter turnout by 5.30% in 2024 which could affect the ruling incumbents negatively due to potential voter fatigue.
   - The male/female voter ratio remains fairly balanced.
### Additional Considerations:
- **Incumbency Factor**: Incumbency can play both a positive and negative role. While A. M. Ariff has the advantage of incumbency, lower voter turnout trends typically suggest a challenge for the incumbent.
- **Political Climate**: The region's socio-political dynamics and any recent developments or issues could sway voter sentiment toward either the UDF or LDF.
### Prediction for 2024:
Given A.M. AriffÆs recent incumbency and the steady presence of CPI(M) in the constituency, along with declining voter turnout which might signal dissatisfaction, we can expect another close contest. The reduced turnout might also suggest mobilization issues that typically affect the ruling party more. 
### Final Prediction:
- **Predicted Elected Member**: K. C. Venugopal
- **Predicted Elected Party**: INC (UDF)
- **Predicted Margin**: 12,000 votes
- **Predicated Vote Share%**: 
  - INC: 44%
  - CPI(M): 42%
  - BJP: 10%
  - Others: 4%
This prediction is based on a combination of historic voting patterns, candidate popularity, and the recent drop in voter turnout which might play against the incumbent LDF party."

# Mavelikkara (SC)
Based on the historical election data and the current context provided for the Mavelikkara (SC) constituency, a detailed analysis for predicting the 2024 election result can be derived through careful examination of trends and factors:
### Historical Context and Trends:
1. **Kodikunnil Suresh's Consistent Victory**: Kodikunnil Suresh from the Indian National Congress (INC) has been the elected member in the last three consecutive elections. His vote share has been consistently around 45% and above.
2. **Turnout Fluctuations and Impacts**: The voter turnout has varied slightly, with a slight increase in 2019 compared to 2014. However, for 2024, there is a noticeable decrease in turnout, dropping to 65.95% from 74.33% in 2019.
3. **Margin of Victory**: The margin of victory for Suresh has also varied, peaking in 2019 with a significant margin of 61,138 votes.
### Analysis for 2024:
1. **Decreased Turnout**: The decreased turnout in 2024 could be indicative of voter apathy or a less mobilized voter base. Lower turnout often impacts the traditional vote bank and can influence margin calculations.
2. **Continued Support**: Given Kodikunnil SureshÆs consistent presence and performance, it is likely he retains substantial support within the constituency.
3. **Opposition Dynamics**: The CPI candidate, Arun Kumar, from the Left Democratic Front (LDF), and Baiju Kalasala from the Bharatiya Janata Party's ally BDJS under the NDA, are the primary challengers. Historically, the LDF has been the main competitor to the INC in Kerala, but they have not managed to unseat Suresh over the past three elections.
4. **Vote Share Consistency**: Historically, Suresh has managed to secure a consistent vote share of around 45%, and there isn't strong evidence in the data provided to suggest a major deviation from this trend in 2024.
### Predicted Election Result for Mavelikkara (SC) in 2024:
1. **Predicted Elected Member**: Kodikunnil Suresh
2. **Predicted Elected Party**: Indian National Congress (INC)
3. **Predicted Vote Share%**: Approximately 45% (+/-2%)
   - Considering the historical consistency and the turnout decrease, a minor fluctuation within a couple of percentage points is reasonable.
4. **Predicted Margin**: Around 30,000 - 35,000 votes
   - With lower voter turnout, the margin may decrease slightly compared to 2019 but stay relatively robust due to Suresh's consistent voter base.
#### Conclusion:
Considering all factors, Kodikunnil Suresh from the INC is anticipated to retain his seat in Mavelikkara (SC) for the 2024 election, continuing his trend of victories albeit with a slightly narrower margin due to decreased voter turnout."

   - In 2014, N.K. Premachandran of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP) won with a vote share of 46.47% and a margin of 37,649 votes, indicating a significant increase in margin.
   - In 2019, N.K. Premachandran of the RSP again won with an even larger vote share of 51.61% and a massive margin of 148,856 votes, solidifying his strong position.

   - **Left Democratic Front (LDF)**: Mukesh Madhavan (CPI(M)).

3. **Voter Turnout Analysis**:
   - The voter turnout in 2024 is reported to be 68.15%, a decrease of 6.58% from the 2019 turnout of 74.73%.
   - The decline in turnout could influence the margins, but itÆs important to note how each partyÆs turnout efforts might differentially impact their base.
4. **Potential Factors**:
   - **Incumbency Factor**: N.K. Premachandran has a strong incumbency advantage with a consistently growing margin and vote share.
   - **Candidate Popularity**: N.K. PremachandranÆs repeated successes likely point to personal popularity and effective campaign strategies.
   - **Opposition Strength**: While Mukesh Madhavan (CPI(M)) and G Krishnakumar (BJP) are substantial candidates, their potential to unseat a strong incumbent seems less probable given historical data.
**Predicted Election Result**:
- **Predicted Elected Member**: N.K. Premachandran
- **Predicted Elected Party**: Revolutionally Socialist Party (RSP)
  
**Predicted Margin and Vote Share**: Based on the historical trend, UDFÆs vote share under N.K.

   - Votes polled are 970,517, indicating a turnout of 69.48%.
Given these points, several inferences can be drawn:

- **Swing Factors**: The margin in 2019 between INC and CPI(M) was 38,247 votes with a vote share difference, suggesting a competitive race.
- **Turnout**: The decrease in voter turnout from 74.48% in 2019 to 69.48% in 2024 could influence the dynamics, potentially favoring the party with more dedicated voter bases, which historically has been CPI(M).
### Predictive Analysis:
1. **Vote Share Predictions**:
   - **INC (Adoor Prakash)**: Incumbency and a slight decrease in turnout might slightly reduce their vote share, but they are likely to maintain strong support. Predicted Vote Share: **38-40%**.
   - **CPI(M) (V Joy)**: With CPI(M) historically performing well and a turnout that might favor them, their vote share could see a minor increase. Predicted Vote Share: **41-43%**.
   - **BJP (V Muraleedharan)**: Historically, BJP hasnÆt been a strong contender in Attingal, but they could secure a modest vote share. Predicted Vote Share: **15-17%**.
2. **Predicted Margin**:
   - With a competitive race between INC and CPI(M), a slight edge could be with CPI(M) due to historical strongholds and decreased turnout.
   - Predicted Margin: **10,000 - 20,000 votes**.
3. **Predicted Outcome**:
   - **Predicted Elected Member**: V Joy
   - **Predicted Elected Party**: CPI(M)
   - **Predicted Margin**: ~15,000 votes
   - **Predicted Vote Share%**:
     - CPI(M): 42%

   - Shashi Tharoor has consistently won the Thiruvananthapuram seat since 2009, indicating significant incumbency advantage and personal popularity.
2. **Turnout Trends:**
   - The voter turnout has shown fluctuations, with a high of 73.74% in 2019 now decreasing to 66.47% in 2024. This reduction indicates a potential decline in voter engagement or satisfaction.
3. **Vote Shares and Margins:**
   - Shashi Tharoor achieved his highest vote share in 2009 (44.46%) and significantly increased his margin in 2019 to almost match his 2009 margin, which suggests a recovery in popularity from the dip seen in 2014.

### Predicted Results for 2024
1. **Predicted Elected Member:**
   - **Shashi Tharoor**
2. **Predicted Elected Party:**
   - **Indian National Congress (INC)**
3. **Predicted Margin:**
   - Given the previous trends and assuming the reduction in turnout does not significantly disadvantage Tharoor:
     - **Estimated Margin:** ~75,000-85,000 votes
       - This considers a slight reduction due to increased competition and decreasing turnout but remains substantial due to incumbency and past performance.

     - **Estimated Vote Share:** ~39-42%
